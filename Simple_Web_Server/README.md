To use the following Arduino code, please download and install the latest Arduino IDE from <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software"> Aruino's main page </a>. The software is intended to run on an
ESP8266 WiFi module, sold seperately.

<h1><b> To get the program up and running, </b></h1>

<p><i>1) Open the installed arduino IDE, <br>
access Tools in the upper left corner, <br>
navigate to "Board:" and click Board Manager <br>
at the top of the list of board options.
<p>2) Search for "esp8266" and install the board- <br>
specific source code. The code will be accessible<br>
via your IDE from the header files in the #include<br>
statements.
<p>3) Compile and export the Simple_Web_Server.ini<br>
file to your ESP8266 WiFi module, and you're ready<br>
